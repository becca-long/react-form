        <h1> Now we gonna make some LISTS</h1>
        <p>There are two types of lists:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>This list doesn't have an order</li>
            <li>It is made up of only bullet points</li>
        </ul>
        <p>But there is a list where some things are more important than others:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>This is an ORDERED LIST</li>
            <li>The most important items are at the top</li>
            <li>And noted with a NUMBER</li>
            <li>Item #1 was most important to know</li>
